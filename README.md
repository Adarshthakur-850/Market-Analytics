Here’s a clean **README.md file** you can add to your GitHub repo **Market-Analytics** to explain the project clearly and professionally. It follows common best practices for data-centric projects: overview, setup, usage, results, and more. ([GitHub][1])

## 📊 Market Analytics

**Market Analytics** is a data analysis project that explores market data to derive insights, visualize trends, and build predictive models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and modeling using Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing market datasets, including:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory visualizations (plots, dashboards)
* Modeling for trend analysis or predictions
* Scripts and notebooks to reproduce results

The goal is to help understand underlying patterns in market data and build a reusable analytics pipeline.
