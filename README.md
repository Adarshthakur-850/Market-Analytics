pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Place your dataset(s)** in the `data/raw/` folder
2. **Run the analysis script**

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **View generated plots** in the `plots/` directory

## 📊 Data Understanding & Approach

### 1. **Data Loading**

Reads market datasets from `data/raw/`, including CSV/Excel files.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**

Handles:

* Missing values
* Outliers
* Inconsistent entries

All cleaned data is saved in `data/processed/`.

### 3. **Exploratory Analysis**

Uses statistical summaries and visual tools to:

* Compare categories
* Identify trends over time
* Correlate variables

### 4. **Visualization**

Generates:

* Line plots
* Bar charts
* Heatmaps
* Distribution plots

These visualizations help identify patterns quickly.
